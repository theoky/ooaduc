Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Use Cases Style File

This is a simple use case style file for LaTeX in case there is no full blown application lifecycle management tool available and Word can be avoided. 

A small sample is included.

The original use case style file has been created by Roland Bruggmann (http://about.geogeek.ch) and is downloadable at https://gist.github.com/brugr9/5178487

This in turn has been inspired by Tom Desair (see  http://www.tomdesair.com/blog/2012/04/latex-template-for-use-cases/ )
